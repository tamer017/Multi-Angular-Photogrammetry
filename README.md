# Multi-Angular Photogrammetry Knowledge Compendium  

This repository documents workflows and processing steps for multi-angular UAV image data using **Agisoft Metashape**. Its aim is to establish a **transparent and reproducible framework** for photogrammetry workflows, with a focus on multi-angular data analysis in plant disease studies.

## Project Overview  

### Objectives  
- **Document Key Processing Steps**: Provide a detailed guide for all major processes in Agisoft Metashape related to multi-angular UAV data.  
- **Address Gaps in Transparency**: Highlight and resolve steps that are under-documented in Metashape’s official materials.  
- **Recommend Alternatives**: Explore and suggest efficient algorithms or workflows.  

### Expected Outcomes  
- A well-documented repository featuring:  
  - Comprehensive guides for Metashape processes.  
  - Transparent alternatives for undocumented workflows.  
  - Recommendations for optimizing multi-angular data processing.
