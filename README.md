# Multi-Angular Photogrammetry Knowledge Compendium

This repository documents the workflows and processing steps for multi-angular UAV image data using Agisoft Metashape. The goal is to provide a transparent and reproducible framework for photogrammetry workflows, focusing on multi-angular data analysis in plant disease studies.

## Project Overview

### Objectives
- **Document Key Processing Steps**: Cover all major processes in Agisoft Metashape for multi-angular UAV data.
- **Highlight Undocumented Steps**: Identify and address gaps in Metashape’s transparency.
- **Suggest Alternatives**: Research and recommend algorithms or workflows for improved efficiency.

### Expected Outcomes
- An accessible GitHub repository with:
  - Documentation for Metashape processes.
  - Transparent alternatives for undocumented steps.
  - Suggestions for data optimization.
