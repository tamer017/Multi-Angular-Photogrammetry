## Introduction

The blending stage is critical in generating high-quality orthomosaics. In overlapping regions, selecting the “best” pixel—typically one with minimal distortion—ensures that the final mosaic accurately reflects the earth’s surface. This document expands on pixel selection strategies by discussing both theoretical foundations and practical implementations, while integrating insights from established literature.

## Rationale for Nadir Pixel Preference

- **Minimal Perspective Distortion:**  
  Images captured with a nadir (vertical) orientation exhibit less geometric distortion than those taken at oblique angles. This reduction in distortion is essential for creating a seamless mosaic where spatial relationships are maintained accurately. For example, Burt and Adelson demonstrated that multi-resolution splines preserve image detail across different frequency bands, thereby minimizing distortion in the final mosaic ([Burt & Adelson, 1983](#ref1)).

- **Higher Resolution and Consistency:**  
  Nadir images generally provide a uniform ground sampling distance (GSD), ensuring consistent spatial resolution across the mosaic. This consistency is crucial to reduce artifacts at seamlines. Studies in drone photogrammetry, such as those by Chon et al. (2010), have shown that maintaining a consistent GSD minimizes mismatches in overlapping areas ([Chon et al., 2010](#ref3)).

## Algorithmic Approaches for Optimal Pixel Selection

### Distortion Metrics

Modern methods often compute reprojection errors from homography transformations to quantify geometric distortion. The optimal pixel for blending is the one that minimizes this error. Zhu et al. (2018) compared various blending algorithms and found that using reprojection error as a criterion effectively selects pixels that closely represent the true ground conditions ([Zhu et al., 2018](#ref5)).

### Quality-Based Weighting in Multi-Band Blending

In multi-band blending, as introduced by Burt and Adelson, images are decomposed into different frequency bands. Low-frequency bands, capturing overall brightness and smooth transitions, are weighted according to a distortion measure, while high-frequency bands preserve fine details. Brown and Lowe further refined this approach for panoramic stitching by combining robust feature matching with weighted blending to reduce ghosting and artifacts ([Brown & Lowe, 2007](#ref2)).

### Manual Versus Automated Selection

- **Manual Adjustment:**  
  Some systems allow users to manually override automated selections in complex regions—such as areas near abrupt transitions or where moving objects are present—to ensure that the most representative pixels are chosen.

- **Automated Selection:**  
  Advanced methods integrate sensor metadata (e.g., camera angle, altitude, and calibration data) with distortion metrics to automatically select optimal pixels. For instance, Pan et al. (2016) proposed a two-step process in which a coarse grid identifies candidate pixels based on minimal reprojection error and a subsequent fine grid refines these selections ([Pan et al., 2016](#ref4)).

### Region-Based Blending Strategies

Instead of selecting pixels individually, some algorithms treat overlapping areas as regions. By blending using regional statistics or selecting a representative pixel for each region, these methods can mitigate the effects of local noise or transient changes. Change detection techniques help distinguish stable (unchanged) from dynamic (changed) regions, thereby assigning higher weights to stable regions for improved radiometric consistency.

## Practical Considerations and Literature Support

- **Handling Dynamic Scenes:**  
  In real-world scenarios, moving objects or changes in illumination can introduce artifacts. Approaches that incorporate temporal analysis—comparing multiple images over time—help select pixels with minimal dynamic interference.

- **Software Implementations:**  
  Commercial tools such as Agisoft Metashape and Pix4D employ combinations of these methods. For example, Agisoft Metashape’s median orthomosaic blending option is designed to mitigate the impact of outlier pixels, ensuring a consistent blend ([Agisoft Metashape User Manual](#ref6); [Agisoft Forum](#ref7)). Pix4D similarly leverages multi-band blending with robust pixel selection algorithms to produce high-quality outputs.

- **Future Directions:**  
  Researchers are exploring adaptive algorithms that adjust blending weights dynamically based on local image content, potentially using machine learning techniques to predict the optimal weights. Such advancements could further enhance both the accuracy and efficiency of orthomosaic generation.

## Summary

Optimal pixel selection in orthomosaic generation depends on minimizing geometric distortion and ensuring radiometric consistency. By combining reprojection error metrics, multi-band weighting, and both manual and automated selection strategies, modern systems can produce mosaics that are both spatially accurate and visually seamless. This discussion builds on classical work by Burt and Adelson (1983) and Brown and Lowe (2007) and incorporates more recent findings by Chon et al. (2010), Pan et al. (2016), and Zhu et al. (2018).
